      <p class="quote"> &quot;The strength of the S&amp;I   Framework is its ability to bring together a community of leaders with   unparalleled experience and expertise in healthcare and health IT.  These people have a drive and a passion for   creating the future of healthcare through easier and more secure exchange of   information, and this is reflected in their dedication to the various S&amp;I   initiatives.&quot;</p>
      <p class="author">- Alice Leiter, Director for Health IT Policy, National Partnership for Women &amp; Families<br />

      <p class="quote"> &quot;One of the major strengths of   the S&amp;I Framework is bringing together stakeholders from a variety of   healthcare backgrounds to work together toward common goals that will benefit   both the patients and user communities. Without a standardized set of guidelines   to use as a goal [as provided by the S&amp;I Framework], I believe that there   would be a lot of duplicate efforts across the board as each organization   tried to interpret the MU [Meaningful Use] requirements and create a unique   set of processes that would meet their own specific needs.&quot;</p>

      <p class="quote"> &quot;I can honestly say [that the   S&amp;I Framework] was a very collaborative effort in generating community   interest and participation.  This   enabled the community stakeholders to work together toward a common goal for   promoting interoperability and meaningful use.  Clinicians, vendors and other community   participants provided real-world feedback and this contribution was valuable   towards establishing and publishing standards to promote interoperability and   a commitment to standards that will drive widespread adoption.&quot;</p>

      <p class="quote"> &quot;What is clear to me is that the   TOC [Transitions of Care Initiative] RI [Reference Implementation] forms a   solid foundation upon which future TOC User Stories can be codified in   computable models and that it clearly lowers the barrier of entry for new innovators,   startups and those not-so-large EMR, HIE and PHR software developers…It is my   expectation that TOC RI and its associated Demos and Pilots will continue to   grow and become an important technical anchor for standardizing Transitions   of Care, simplifying the complexity of disparate document formats, lowering   the cost of entry for HIT innovators and ultimately driving the cost of   Healthcare down through the disruptive innovation it manifests. &quot;</p>
